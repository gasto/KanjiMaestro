KanjiMaestro

Title Page
KanjiMaestro: A overly confident maestro(teacher) queries you with countless exercises in a way that you can choose the correct option. As the game advances one needs solve the kanji matching in different mini-games.

Executive Summary
•	Is a 2D mini-game compilation with a main teacher figure as the guide of the game. It allows top down view of a dragon that catches matching kanjis bestowing special abilities indicated by the meaning of the kanji itself.
•	The dragon(the player) and its nemesis(the CPU controlled NPC) start searching for the shown kanji in barrels, couffins, boxes, bushes, benches and so on, depending on the currentl level theme.
•	The dragons open their way through the maze that allows them to view the clearly visible required kanji. Similar to the flashcard style games, the dragon games will allow to choose between:  kanji completion of a word completion; word completion of a phrase; sound, image or animation concept matching with kanji.
•	The dragons are tired and they need replenishing, the replenishing kanji must be obtained before complete exhaustion. The same goes for thirst, lust(or infatuation as an euphemism), hunger, power up need to pass through special door, key, jumping ability, flight and so on.
•	The dragons eat the kanji that will serve as the query for the opponent, so in this mode, the more difficult the kanji eaten, the better. The punishment for not matching the kanji to the correct concept(once again, either image, sound or animation) will be related to the concept itself. For example the punishment for not solving a riddle regarding 鬼（おに、demon） would be to be cursed by a demon for a minute or so with pestering: fire attacks, traps and visibility obstacles.
•	(Optional) draw kanjis at will with the mouse to cast a special ability when opportune.
•	(Optional) spell the kanjis with a microphone and through speach recognition allow the player to cast the kanji(as a power-up) when handy.
•	Most of the rest of mini-games are kanji matching games.
•	Match the kanji with the hiragana word.
•	Complete the sentence with the missing kanji.
•	Associate the kanji with the matching image, sound or animation.
•	Place the words in the correct slot so as to logically reorder the sentence structure.
•	Match kanji with corrisponding kunyomi and/or onyomi.
•	(Optional) a "point and shoot" puzzle that throws kanji bubbles at other bubbles to form words and burst them(Similar tu puzzle bubble.)
•	Special sound effects and 2D animations on th background as reinforcement/punishment.


Game Overview

High Concept
A fun and engaging kanji game with a major teacher; colourful scenarios and catchy sound effecta and music;
NPC path-finding and concept matching features.


Genre
"Point and click" genre that combines aspects of puzzle and 2D top view adventure game, that allows directional movement of a dragon around a maze-like topdown environment, while changing minigame as the missions are accomplished.

Hooks
•	Kanji learning made fun with visual clues and interactive environments
•	Concepts that match kanjis through animations images or power-ups.  Gameplay is directly related to kanji meaning.
•	8-bit elements like talking is 8-bit babbling, and special effects may be as simple as fade into pixelated images.
•	(Optional) procedurally generated exercises, this would allow NPCs to use markov chains to learn kanji meanings. Very ambitious, because it would use also NLP(Natural Language Processing.)

License

License will be closed and will be sold as a commercial product, probably in the $0.15 to $5 range.

Gameplay Highlights


•	Nemesis AI will use A* pathfinding for reaching to what it believes(through perhaps machine learning) to be the correct matching kanji.
•	Other NPCs will probably use scripted movements and actions based on finite state machines.
	


Online Highlights
•	The game will probably only feature score boards upload
•	Score after finishing a session of a game can be uploadad to official website's world score board.
•	If time allows, perhaps the game could be played against another player by punishing the opponent when he/she looses with items gained in the process of kanji matching or searching(kanjiDragon game).

Technology Highlights

•	Simple but effective 2D texture effects that allow the player to feel hyped about winning or punished by loosing.

•	A* pathfinding, finite state machines and machine learning(markov chains) are 
used throughout the game for enhancing gameplay, NPCs and scoring behaviour.


Art and Audio Highlights

•	Many animations for Maestro(the guide, tutor and questioner) and the dragon, enemies and nemesis.
•	Many backgrounds perhaps with patterns for the word matching section. For the dragon levels, varied scenarios with ice, fire, natural and metalic and high teck themes.
•	Audio is clear and consise, perhaps some voice acting by myself and other voice actors for il maestro and dragon gestures.
•	Animations are made in 3D or 2D animation tools and rendered in 2D so as to use sprites. Smooth animations with colourful characters and items.
•	Music is tender and lobby-like. Lounge songs for the Kanji matching games, and adventure/epic tale style themes for the dragon mini-game.
•Resolution:
The game will support various resolutions:
1920x1080p
1680x1050
1024x768
And all the corrisponding resolutions bellow them following their ratios:
16:9
8:5
4:3

Resolutions need to be thought out since most of it will be sprite based, and the majority of monitors are of the aforementioned ratios.



Hardware

•	PC Windows from XP upwards(DirectX9)
•	Minimal specs are: 1GB of RAM, ATI or Nvidia Graphics card with 128MB of RAM and 1.2Ghz processor.

Production Details
It will be just me and Kevin Josue Cruz for now, both on graphics and programming. Furthermore, I will develop sound effects and musical score.

Current Status
We start at zero, with DirectX9 as the rendering engine.The proof of concept will be ready as soon as we develop the prototype, the minimal features will be shown-off. 


Development Team
Programers: 
Gabriel Hasbun: Screencaster, programmer(C,C++,Python) and producer of music and artwork.
Kevin Josue Cruz: Programmer with shader experience, and 3D animation.



Budget
$0, all done in freetime and with a lot of passion.

Schedule
6 months since start. Today is 20/06/2014

Market competition
No competition whatsoever. Kanji games tend to be simple matching games without adventure and minigame elements. Most of them are also web based, which limits the graphical performance capabilites.

Game World
The main screen should be prestended by Il maestro. A small introduction tutorial on the different
features should be the starting point.

Backstory
Il Maestro is just a guy trying to teach you Kanji, however he realizes that in order to motivate you to improve, he grants score points to allow to buy other challanges(mini-games).

Objective
What is the player’s overall objective, the thing she is trying to achieve to complete the game? This doesn’t have to be the “true” objective, however—the player can find evidence of a deeper and more serious problem as he plays. 
Finish as much challenges that il maestro poses, as well as acquire new levels, new skills and gameplay mechanics. The ultimate reward is becomming a kanji master. High scores are uploaded to the official website's server.

Characters
Il maestro: The main guide, that allows the player to understand the underlying mechanics of the varying mini-games

Mission or Story Progression
The player starts as a complete beginner knowing perhaps nothing at all. Il maestro would query the player for the difficulty: Novice, beginner, intermediate and advanced. Some incomplete hiragana and katakana phrases would be posed, and the blank line would be expected to be filled with the corrisponding kanji. More advanced exercises would contain more advanced grammar and major usage of kanji.
